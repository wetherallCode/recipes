Carrot-Cake Recipe


2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar			
1 teaspoon baking powder				
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 cups shredded carrot
1 cup cooking oil
4 eggs

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour a 13x9x2-inch baking pan (or two 9x1½-inch round baking pans).  In a mixer bowl combine the ingredients, beating with electric mixer till combined.  Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Turn into pan(s).  Bake in a 325 degree oven for 50 to 60 minutes in the 13x9x2-inch pan or till done.  (For two 9-inch layers, bake in a 325 degree oven for 40 minutes or till done.)  Cool on a wire rack.  (Remove layers from pans after cooling 10 minutes.  Cool well.)  Frost with Cream Cheese Frosting, below.  Serves 12 to 15.



Cream Cheese Frosting

6 ounces cream cheese, softened
½ cup butter, softened 
2 teaspoons vanilla
4 cups powdered sugar (I usually throw in a pound box.)
1 cup to 1  1/2 cups finely chopped pecans (I personally think the nuts make this cake, but that’s just me so use fewer pecans if you wish.)

In a mixer bowl, beat together cream cheese, butter, and vanilla till light and fluffy.  Gradually add powdered sugar, beating till smooth.  Spread over cooled cake; sprinkle with chopped nuts.  If making layer cake, frost only tops of the two layers.  Cover; store in the refrigerator.
